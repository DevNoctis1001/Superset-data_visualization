This file tracks the changes we have pushed to lyft-master but not apache/incubator-superset master.
lyft-master is a branch in a Lyft fork of apache/incubator-superset that has cherries applied to it.
Since then, we have modified these "cherries" and/or added files. Please add changes done to this
file to help us track how close or far we are from apache/incubator-superset master.

1. Kepler changes
- @superset-ui/legacy-preset-chart-kepler has been added to package.json
- webpack.config.js has been updated to tell Babel not to parse files in the type-analyzer package
  because it contains CommonJS files. If Babel parses such files, it will mix require and export
  default in a module, which is not allowed.
- KeplerChartPreset has been added in superset/assets/src/visualizations/presets/MainPreset.js
- class KeplerViz in superset/viz.py is still there
- Two controls ("Read Only Mode" and "Config" controls) in  
  superset/assets/src/explore/controls.jsx are still there.
- superset/assets/src/explore/controlPanels/Kepler.js is still there
- Registering the kepler plugin in superset/assets/src/setup/setupPlugins.ts is still there.
- kepler dependency in package.json and package-lock.json has been removed
- superset/assets/src/visualizations/Kepler/Kepler.css has been removed
- superset/assets/src/visualizations/Kepler/Kepler.jsx has been removed
- superset/assets/src/visualizations/Kepler/KeplerChartPlugin.js has been removed
- superset/assets/src/visualizations/presets/DeckGLChartPreset.js has been removed

2.superset/views/lyft.py and core.py
We are "intercepting" sql_json and other calls to authenticate then passing down into actual superset functions.  To do this we have added endpoints in lyft.py, but also have broken the apache endpoints (like sql_json) into the request handler itself (ie sql_json) and a shared library function (sql_json_call) that is used by both the apache and lyft version of the endoint.

3. superset/views/core.py again
in sql_json_call, we have changed the arg to take a json object named request_json (instead of original request) and string replaced all of the usages of request.json to use request_json. This lets us create a dictionary of request param to pass into the sql_json_call method. We need this because our callers such as amundsen are not json encoding data in calls, and superset had a breaking API change that expects them to be encoded.
