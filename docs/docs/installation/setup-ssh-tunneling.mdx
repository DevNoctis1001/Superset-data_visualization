## SSH Tunneling

1. Turn on feature flag
    - Change (this value)[https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/config.py#L489] to `True`
    - If you want to add more security when establish the tunnel we allow users to overwrite the `SSHTunnelManager` class (here)[https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/config.py#L507]
    - You can also set the (`SSH_TUNNEL_LOCAL_BIND_ADDRESS`)[https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/config.py#L508] this the host address where the tunnel will be accessible on your VPC

2. Create database w/ ssh tunnel enabled
    - Superset allows for 2 different type authenticaion (Basic + Private Key). These credentials should come from your service provider.
